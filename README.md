# Guides

General purpose utility guides for Chevereto that we make generally available.

## Readme

We share just for share, for hoarding information used in the context of our software. In most cases this information is spread online and hard to find so we are collecting that on our own, for our users.

Please note that guides in this repository are available "as-is", no official support is available for these and please don't disturb the contributors with support inquiries.

If you need extra support you can contact us directly for that matter from our main website.
